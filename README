xv6 Operating System Enhancements

This repository contains enhancements and additions to the xv6 operating system. Each branch represents a specific feature or improvement aimed at making xv6 more powerful and efficient.

Features
Priority Scheduler for xv6
https://github.com/SamRamir/Myxv6/blob/0713ffaf8728569cb3cbea424fe30ee6a945fd4a/Priority%20Scheduler%20Samuel%20Ramirez.pdf

Introduces a priority-based scheduler to enhance task scheduling.
Time Command
https://github.com/SamRamir/Myxv6/blob/ab0ff31dd07e50e0f9b6e44485f6080e6f0ff56d/Time%20Command%20Samuel%20Ramirez.pdf

Adds a new command to measure and display execution times.
Semaphores for xv6

Implements semaphores for better synchronization and coordination between processes.
Anonymous Memory Mappings for xv6

Enhances memory management by introducing support for anonymous memory mappings.
Lazy Allocation for xv6

Optimizes memory allocation using lazy allocation strategies.

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu). The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu. Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
